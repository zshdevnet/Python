```python
# A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
# An instance is a specific object created from that class.

# Note: ABCs are for enforcing method implementations in subclasses.
```

```python
# Itâ€™s called automatically when an object is created, setting up initial values.
```

``` Clarification of SELF:

self is a reference to the current instance of the class.

It is used to access attributes and methods of the class inside its own methods.

If you have multiple instances, self is how the class knows which one it's working with.
